Hello hello hello....is there anybody out there??


Hiya everyone!  New to all of this so please accept my apologies for any glaring mistakes!  So anyways...a little about me...I come from a cold,wet dark and dreary landlocked paradise. I know I know....that sounds crazy, but when the sun decides to finally come and play drying everything it touches the beauty is awe inspiring. Breathtakingly beautiful it leaves you speechless. Rain or shine you can find me hiking in the woods or on the beach. I love to fish and hunt. When I am stuck inside you can find me either on the couch watching a movie while playing around on my phone, quilting, watering my plants or any type of art project.
